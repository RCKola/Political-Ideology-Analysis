Trump announces Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will head the Department of Government Efficiency \n Give us doge memes where he's chasing after all the wasteful departments and shitty employees!,1
"Government has a Spending Problem \n I honestly don't think either care.

Republicans: cut taxes and the extra GDP will increase taxe revenue in the future from growing economy and make up for the new deficit.

Which has never happened because they always raise the deficit more so if they are right, it'll never catch up from new future deficits.

Democrats Inflation reduction act: spend lots of money now, it'll pay for itself in the future from job growth.

Both are doing the same dumb stuff and marketing it the same say but neither will actually stop increasing deficits for anything they claim to actually happen if true.",1
"The left treats January 6 like Trump “is a fascist” and refuses to relinquish power \n If nothing else, he absolutely to this day maintains that the election was stolen, he even mentioned it in his speech at the RNC. 


Stuff like that absolutely tears at the fabric of society.",1
"‘She’s So F*cking Pathetic’: Trump Slams Kamala, ‘Old Broken-Down Pile Of Crap’ Biden In Leaked Video \n Kinda shitty to secretly record someone like this in a private moment.  Although this would be 5D chess if it was intentionally leaked...",1
"Breaking: Obama-Appointed Judge Forces Trump to Fund SNAP in Schumer Shutdown – There's Just One Problem \n ""Federal Judge orders Mars to be green, and cotton candy to taste like butterscotch.""

Why Won’t Kamala Harris Say Abortions Up to Birth are Wrong? \n She supports abortion up to birth and even after. She just can't say it because it's unpopular and immoral and turns off the swing voters she needs.,1
13 Republicans join Democrats to advance bill reversing Trump union order \n It really is the uni-party. Republicans don't have any desire to gain ground.,1
"The Biden administration has found a way to keep forgiving student loans \n https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-19/biden-cancels-5-billion-in-student-debt-in-latest-relief-step

The article states that 43,900 of those getting debt relief are “public servants.” That means (I presume) government workers. So nearly 60% of the 74,000 people whose loans will now be paid off via deficit financing work for government, not private sector.",1
"Dear Leftist lurkers/brigadiers, now that you  ""got Trump"" will you expect your DAs to use that same level of power to prosecute illegal immigrants and gang violence in your blue cities/states? \n There are likely several thousand politicians on both sides that should be behind bars.",1
"Remember when the Left said President Trump would start WW3? \n My first thought as well.  

""Something something Putin something something collusion something something make Biden look bad""",1
Why do they always say compromise but refuse to? \n I honestly haven’t hear much about compromise from either side. That’s why people don’t like congress and their bloated bills - that’s what compromise looks like in reality. “I will let you have this if you give me this” real compromise in politics is ugly and most the time everyone leaves unhappy.,1
"Dems call on Biden to seize control of Texas National Guard, as GOP allies back Abbott ! \n Its an invasion. Dems dont seem to care that Biden ignored the supreme court with student loans!",1
"Bret Baier: the Fox News anchor set to grill Kamala Harris once called ‘nasty’ by Trump \n I'm sorry, but I'm expecting softballs with no fact checking or follow up from Mr. Baier.  

Then Kamala gets to crow about how she ""went on fox"".  

Baier is the Austin of Fox's Texas.",1
"Remember when every poll in 2016 had Hillary leading Trump by a massive margin? They gave her a 70-80% chance of winning. Polls don't mean anything... All that matters is what happens on election day. \n I voted 3rd party in 2016, and at that time only really knew about trump from the smear campaign, but i was in the early stages of trump support, which for a lot of people began as trump defense. 

As someone who cares about accuracy in reporting i was reading headlines and hearing talking points and being like hmm that sounds pretty extreme, and checked only to find that it was totally false. So around the water cooler i started “actually thats not true”ing people. The media basically groomed me into trump support by making me defend him constantly. 

Anyway, i went to bed early on election night 2016, believing the polls and with clinton in the lead. 

I had to watch the highlight reel of the meltdowns the next day. My favorite was the_meltdown was set up to document trump supporters inevitable meltdown over trump losing and seamlessly transitioned into clinton camp salt mining.",1
"Ex-CBS Reporter: We Couldn't Find Real-Life Impacts of Gov't Shutdown, So Dems Rigged Fake Scenes for Us to Photograph \n Somehow, this does not shock me at all. The media would make shit up to further the cause? No!",1
"BREAKING: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis just said he’s pushing to end property taxes in Florida. \n Property taxes are high if it's your second or third home or claim primary residence in another state. If you have a homestead exemption, your property taxes are in line with most other states. This is a bad policy designed as a good one; it'll benefit the wealthy at the expense of the poor, ultimately forcing people to pay higher sales taxes. ""But my seniors!"" Seniors qualify for a bunch of other tax credits *beyond* the homestead exemption... again, for primary residences.",1
Trump Seeks 'Full Arena Audience' for Sept. 4 Debate With Harris \n I genuinely hope no one (on either side) will vote based on a joke or witty line.,1
"Republicans win majority of US House seats in government sweep \n its funny reading about how trump and elon ""bought the election"" when kamala out spent them 5-1. 

I'm convinced that redditors on r/politics are the greatest midwits of our generation.",1

there are some last minute votes that we need to add.",1
"Of course it was a setup, just like J6 is a setup. Nowadays all the corrupt federal govt does is operate hit operations and lawfare against its political opponents. This whole thing was designed to keep Trump out of WH \n Soon to be the former Gateway Pundit, they filed for bankruptcy last Wednesday following litigation after the site made false claims that the 2020 U.S. election was stolen.  Apparently no lessons were learned.",1
"Donald Trump has arrived for UFC 314 in Miami \n I remember all the times Biden would go to events and crowds works cheer him!  fjb,  fjb they would chant.  can't believe he didn't get a second term lol",1
"Reddit (and Social Media) is not reality \n I’m sorry but no. I’ve seen opinions that are celebrating on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Reddit, X, and from a few of my “family” and “friends” (no longer associated with them). This is very much reality.",1
"Trump currently favored to win the popular vote! \n Vote like he's ten points down, but it would sure be something if he won the popular vote! Even the fact that polls are this close is bad news for the Harris campaign.",1
"Hunter Biden claims he didn’t think ‘laptop from hell’ was really his when damning contents first revealed by The Post \n There were **at least three** laptops, possibly four.

There's the one he lost to Russian drug dealers - he passed out and when he woke up they were gone and so was his laptop.

There's the one he left at his therapist's office - the FBI got that one and it never saw the light of day again.

There's the one he left for repair with Mac Isaacs. He called law enforcement when he realized what was on it, and the FBI seized it and the copy of the hard drive, and buried them. ...only Mac had made *another* copy of the drive just in case, which is how it got to Rudy Giuliani and defeated the FBI's attempt to bury it.

A **fourth** laptop was copied while Hunter was in China. Anti-Chinese government operatives obtained the copy and leaked it at about the same time as the contents of the Isaacs drive went public.",1
"Trump clinches 2024 Republican presidential nomination during Tuesday's primaries \n Very good question. 

Even Reagan himself had a highly contested race initially against George Bush in the 1980 primary that risked dividing the vote. Which is why Reagan selected him as VP. 

It took Reagan about 2 months in the primary to be the clear front runner over Bush.",1
"Trump officials rip CNN, MSNBC for refusing to air Rachel Morin’s mom’s emotional remarks \n I had hoped that Democrats would begin changing their tune after blown out this election but apparently that will not be happening. 

The Trump administration has been far from perfect, but their decisions seem to me to be pro America and American.",1

Apparently self-care is like, the patriarchy, or something.",1
Trump announces 100% tariffs on all foreign-produces movies \n How would you even do this if most movies are a digital commodity now? Does the foreign studio have to pay a tariff to transmit the files? What if the crew is half American and half local on location? That gets into imposing tariffs on digital products and the lawyers are going to have a field day with it.,1
"UK Labour Party activists campaigning for Kamala Harris in US ‘likely to break electoral law’ \n Surely, the libs who endlessly parroted about muh Russian collusion are going to denounce this as well, right?",1
"Voting for Biden because you don't want to vote for Trump is like eating feces because you don't want to eat broccoli. \n In races like this where there are two known candidates, the decision for most people is not whether to vote for/against Trump or Biden. The decision is whether to vote or stay home.

We’ll know when we see turnout numbers, but I’m guessing there are hundreds of thousands of Americans who know Biden isn’t up for the job, but they sure as heck can’t bring themselves to vote for Trump. So instead they’ll just stay home.

I don’t think the Democrat Party as a whole is worried about losing votes to Trump right now. People largely made up their mind months ago. They’re worried about turnout and what that means for down-ballot races.",1
Transgender women to be banned from Capitol Hill female bathrooms under new House GOP proposal \n I'm great with more single occupancy bathrooms. I prefer the privacy. But they take up more space and aren't easy to change out in lots of spaces.,1
You can't go anywhere on this site without seeing *severe* TDS. \n I saw TDS on a recipe/cooking subreddit the other day.  Somebody mentioned soybeans and it was off to the races.  These people are unhinged.,1
"Joe Rogan supports RFK Jr., hurting Trump - Washington Examiner \n He’s also said that he only has people on his show who make no demands about what can or can’t be talked about. Trump (or most other political candidates tbh) comes with a laundry list of “can’t talk about this or that, don’t bring that up, and you can never contradict me”

Also - Rogan is the embodiment of a classic libertarian given the heavy drug use and push for legalization/de-scheduling so this shouldn’t be a huge shock to anyone",1

"Nintendo Boss Shuts Down Leftist Talking Point that Trump’s Tariffs Caused High ‘Switch 2’ Console Price \n From my understanding the Liberation Day chart showed 34-49% for imports from these countries, and the White House turned down Vietnam’s offer.  Which is not to say a deal will not be reached. 

In the meantime, Nintendo is having to consider eating the additional costs or increasing the price to offset and protect their profits as the US is a massive market for them.

It’s an uncertain situation for them and they are rightly taking time to assess the situation.  If a deal is reached, then the price stays the same.  If not, then the price could potentially be affected. 

Edit: clarifications",1

Trump Says He Could End Chicago Crime in 1 Month \n 30x longer than he said it would take to end the war in Ukraine. Not sure what that says about Chiraq,1
"What do you think is the biggest reasons that the Democrats lost the election? \n People were sick and fed up of being lied to that the President wasn't completely incapacitated and that others weren't in control. They were sick and tired of being told we were in the best economy ever while record inflation eroded their wages and they continued to negotiate with the powers that be for new NAFTAs. They were sick and tired of being told that giving illegal migrants free debit cards while they struggled was perfectly normal. 

In short...they were sick and tired of being told the dystopia that was being forced on them was normal and they were racists if they said or believed otherwise. 

Not everyone who voted Trump was voting for Trump...some were voting for RFK, others for Tulsi. Trump's greatest accomplishment in this cycle was creating a coalition that comprised different people from different backgrounds all coming together to make america functional again. 

It wasn't just the economy, people voted out the Dems in 2016 when the economy was completely fine then too because the Dems were pushing multiple NAFTA like agreements that were going to further demolish the working class in Michigan and Wisconsin.",1
Why did Team Trump agree to all of these ridiculous Debate Rules? \n I think team Biden has put in enough fail safes for Biden to be ok... the debate will work in Biden's favor as it will be just enough for people to see he can still somewhat keep it together. There's not a chance team Biden agreed to this unless they were certain they could control the outcome.,1

Iran's government, wanting to save face and not look like an absolute joke to its people, pulled a performative 'attack' in which it warned Israel ahead of time because they didn't actually want a true escalation.

It was pure theatre and as planned Israel fended it off unharmed.

Israel gets a win by killing their guy, and Iran gets a semi-win by 'retaliating.' There's literally zero need to escalate and even less of a need for us to get involved.

Why are we firing Forest Service/National Park Service workers \n I totally agree with you. If anything these agencies need more funding. Not having enough staff means things like entrance fees won't be collected either - so you're actually losing money as opposed to saving anything. Not to mention for a party that talks about law and order - firing rangers etc means people will be leaving litter in parks and breaking rules. Again - these are things people get ticketed for which makes money. I really don't understand it - I think it's partly Musk's blanket approach to federal employees as opposed to looking at each individual agency.,1

Pollsters are going to be releasing their final polls (the ones everyone grades them on) and campaigns are making their final pitches and rallies, the latter which will show where they think their advantage is.

The fact that Harris is spending so much time in the blue wall states makes me think she realizes that's her only path to victory.  Walz is going to GA and AZ, but Trump is way ahead of where he was in 2020/2016 in both of those places with only Marist showing them tied in GA (which is a left-leaning poll).  And Harris doesn't necessarily need either of those if the blue wall holds, which is why she's there and Walz is making the outreach (although that'd be a *tight* win).

The real sign will be those final polls though.  Many say they've fixed the issues of 2016 and 2020, but only time will tell.  Michigan, for example, had Biden by almost 9 and Clinton by 7 at this point.  Biden won Michigan by less than 3%.  A 6% swing to Trump from here would be the start of... a nightmarish bad night for CNN, MSNBC and reddit.

"Republicans Need To Learn How To Go After The Left \n Or, now hear me out, flesh out policy positions and create a plan of action that doesn't depend on ""fighting the Dems"".

"Candace Owens Says the GOP Is Trying to ‘Make “Radical Islam” Happen’ \n Oh Candace, poor, poor Candace. The core right in the U.S. is concerned about mass migration from predominantly Islamic countries and a lack of adaptation to the American way of life. That’s more often seen as the gateway for radical Islam in the U.S. No “billion-dollar campaign” is needed to convince them of the dangers there, as they have Europe as a prime example of what that future looks like if they allow it to happen here.

The reason I say “poor Candace” is because she has obviously been rejected by the fundamentalist Christian right and is now attempting to endear herself to the Groypers. The problem with that strategy is that this crowd is flush with bigots who will never truly accept her. She might get some attention for a little bit during this crash-out, but ultimately she’ll end up a forgotten relic of the internet.

If Candace has any real integrity, she should go after both sides of the Middle East lobby, but then she’d lose all major sources of funding to spew her regular rage-bait hate speech.",1

"“Saving democracy” by ending it \n My personal belief is you had a bunch of protesters who were pissed that they had at best lost the election, at worst had it stolen, so some gasoline basically.. then they had a few people (ray epps etc) act as the “match”.  Mob mentality takes over and there you go.  I’m guessing there were a lot of “matches” there that day, leading on a bunch of rightfully pissed off people on.

"Bidens throws staff under the bus, lashes out at reporters in rare press conference \n The most difficult part of my grandfather's final years were the mood swings. He had a Ph.D. in Arabic literature, had been published dozens of times, taught at a couple major universities for decades. When he first got diagnosed with Alzheimer's, he would just lose context. He'd forget who the president was, you'd be talking to him and he'd reply with a complete non-sequitor, and, stereo-typically, he'd lose shit all the time. As it started though it wasn't alarming, we all knew him as the absent minded professor. I personally have an ability (habit?) to disappear into whatever has my attention that has inspired comparisons from family and his former colleagues. My dad realized something was wrong though when he broke him from a reverie and he wasn't simply irritated, but truly angry. It was jarring, he was such a mild mannered man, and here he was shouting at my dad (a high powered and extremely accomplished surgeon at this point in his life) like he was 13 and made off with the car again to go joyride.

Toward the end he was barely functional. He was a shell of himself, barely answered to his own name. He'd piss himself in his sleep because he couldn't make it to the bathroom and was never able to work the top on the urine bottle. Half the time when he woke up he thought he lived in Paris again and start trying to speak French. He moved from Paris to the states in the mid 70's. Flat refused to leave his home though if he was dressed in anything other than a full suit, it's funny the behaviors that remain.

I write all this to say I see my grandfather in Joe Biden. His family letting this charade continue is what disgusts me the most.

I'm starting to see it in my dad too and he won't hear it. I keep telling him to go see a neurologist, but no he's the best doctor to have ever lived and he's fine. Bull headed prick.",1

"17% Say America Would Be Better Off If Trump Had Been Killed \n If you're thinking riots and burning down cities ala BLM, or states seceding... neither is likely to come from right wing disillusionment at the system.

At first it wouldn't be anything major.  Conservatives withdrawing from participation in the system.  Voluntary disenfranchisement.  That sort of thing.  No outright resistance... Just not showing up to a rigged playing field anymore.

But, sooner or later, that would inevitably result in the leftists, who would inherit the system simply by virtue of being the only people showing up to play the game, trying to force conservatives to do something they refuse to do.  Possibly in relation to gun control and the 2nd amendment.  Or perhaps taxation.

DeSantis is right, the voters want to give Trump another shot, he is better than Biden, and Haley is best suited for the 2008 nomination.

He’s my pick for president, and without the 12th amendment, for VP. I hope he finds a role in Trump’s presidency, that keeps him relevant. This man seems genuine, has a great track record, and at the end of the day, still has a lot of what makes Trump great minus the baggage; the draw all along.

No. They don't. People are generally not very economically literate, and that goes for double when we're talking about government spending which they don't see.

Even as he boomed at them for not knowing provinces, he never named one himself. I don't know them either, but that doesn't mean I want Russia (whose provinces or states or whatever I don't know) to overthrow Ukraine. I don't know but a couple of cities in Israel, but my knowing Gaza doesn't mean I support Palestine or Hamas.

The ability of them to state the names of sections of Ukraine doesn't have much material value in the situation. Sure, I'd like them to know those things, but there isn't a thing on this planet stopping them from looking at a map and memorizing them before the election. Their memorizing those names does not suddenly improve their policies either.

I don't suddenly like Christie if he starts telling me the names of provinces in Ukraine. Haley's ability to tell me pronvicial capitals isn't getting me to sign up for Twitter to doxx myself for her amusement. I don't like either of them, but it's not because of their time spent reading a map.",1

Yes insurance companies do pay for stuff for millions. They also deny a **lot** of necessary care and make people's last years and months a living hell all for the sake of increased profits.

"Over 50% Of Liberal, White Women Under 30 Have A Mental Health Issue \n I want to add on here. 

I'm halfway through my Master's in Clinical Mental Health Counseling, and am starting to narrow down on my theoretical orientation. 

As much as I don't want to be like everybody else, I'm resonating most with cognitive behavioral theory. CBT says that the main issue is not the event that happened to you, it's the things you believe about the event that happened to you. 

You can believe yourself right into depression. Don't get me wrong, I'm *not* saying depression is the fault of the sufferer. What I am saying is you can choose to fight it, or turn towards it. 

When I was in the army, we always rolled our eyes at the ""resiliency training"" they'd make us do in basic training. It was gosh awful. But that's the essential premise—""how do we teach soldiers to be resilient in the face of a painful circumstance so that they don't believe these falsehoods about them and their environment?""

My theory is that we have taught women to be helpless and gentle and they (proverbial ""they"", not all white women. Just many of the women in this study) lack skills of resiliency. 

Immigrants (of the voluntary kind, not refugees) seem to be less likely to suffer mental health challenges than U.S. born individuals. I think that can be attributed to their wonder and gratefulness of being in America. They could have the worst day ever and still go ""at least I'm in America"".",1

"I’m conservative, but getting these texts 400 times a day is really starting to make me change my mind… \n So…

What is happening is there is a single company out there that has your number.

That company sells their list to XYZ org. Be it a PAC, or Party, or Candidate, or company/org.

The first company does not ever text you. They only sell to others as a known-Republican or known-gun-grabber or known-abortion-hater, etc.

The people that text you do actually respect a STOP message. But, they may be single use PACs. The same people will start a new one, re-buy the list, then text you again.

There is no stopping it. And it absolutely should be illegal spamming.

Who are you going to ask to fix it? Congress that benefits from it?

The only things you can do:

1. A Spam service, they read your texts and sell that data. It might work, but you are still a product.

2. Reply stop. Delete the conversation immediately. When they send a text message saying “ok removed” your phone may let you then mark that as spam. It doesn’t do much, but it doesn’t hurt. You shouldn’t reply to texts that don’t have the stop message though - those are different and you don’t want to confirm there is a real human on your side. If they have the stop they may be scared of breaking the law and may actually remove you. But again… some of these are single use orgs. Some aren’t, if X person’s campaign buys the list and you remove, you are removed. However, it’s subcontracting all the way down.

Over the years I've become a definite conservative as per US political system. But I'm in the minority here as people around me are all very liberal.

When I was new here, a liberal would listen to your side of the story and at the end politely agree to disagree. Over the last few years, if you don't agree to their point of view right away they call you a racist, bigot, supremacist, etc. There are no more true liberals here now.

"Democrat governor apologises after ‘mocking Christianity’ in Dorito feeding video \n **From The Telegraph's US Correspondent, David Millward:** 

Michigan’s Democratic governor has apologised for a video in which she fed [Doritos](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/09/05/e-number-doritos-dye-transparent-skin-experiment-mice/) to a kneeling podcast host in what was seen as mocking the Holy Communion.

The video was intended to promote one of Joe Biden’s flagship achievements, [the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/04/10/chips-glut-expose-folly-industrial-strategies/) which invested nearly $53 billion to boost the semiconductor industry in the US.

But Gretchen Whitmer’s attempt at humour in the video with Liz Plank, [a TikTok content creator](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/09/04/tiktok-traditional-trad-catholic-trend/), backfired spectacularly in the pivotal state where Catholics account for 18 per cent of the population.

Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, rounded on Ms Whitmer, who had been seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party.

“Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer insulted Catholics nationwide when she intentionally ridiculed the eucharist in a video,” Mr Donohue said.

“There is no way to understand this stunt other than as an expression of vintage anti-Catholic bigotry. Whitmer’s team, and her allies in the media, are trying to distort what she did.

“There are indeed many clips of people feeding each other on social media, but there is no reference to the CHIPS Act, nor are they eating chips. The typical video on TikTok shows one person sitting at a table, often in a restaurant, being fed — usually with a fork or spoon — by a friend,” he added.

“None of them are kneeling. None of them are receiving food on the tongue.

“What Whitmer did was to deride Holy Communion. There is no wiggle room for her to deny the obvious.”

Following the backlash, Ms Whitmer said she never intended to mock anybody’s faith.

“Over 25 years in public service, I would never do something to denigrate someone’s faith. I’ve used my platform to stand up for people’s right to hold and practise their personal religious beliefs,” she said.

Offending Catholic voters could prove costly to the Harris campaign especially after she decided to skip one of the church’s blue-ribbon events, the Al Smith Dinner.

Timothy Dolan, New York cardinal, observed that the last presidential candidate to miss the event was [Walter Mondale](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2021/04/20/walter-mondale-us-vice-president-carter-trounced-reagan-white/) in 1984 who lost 49 out of 50 states to Ronald Reagan.

As things stand, Kamala Harris has a wafer-thin [two-point lead over Donald Trump in Michigan](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/07/us-election-2024-poll-tracker-trump-harris/) which has 15 votes in the Electoral College.

"Trump supports immigration visas backed by Musk: ‘I have many H-1B visas on my properties’ \n If Americans “won’t take a job”, you need to first stop and ask why. And the answer needs to be convincing.

Then once you have the correct answer, you can decide what to do.

Sometimes, the job shouldn’t even exist, like if a company is using slave-like labor to try to undercut other companies that don’t use that labor.

Sometimes, it’s an issue of talent being in the wrong location in the US. Like you have a job opening in the midwest, but everyone qualified is looking for jobs in California. So do you work harder to convince the Californian to relocate? Or do you try to train more people local in that state to be qualified? Or do you move the job, or perhaps allow the Californian to work remotely? Or do you hire an H1B, because they will be more willing to relocate to anywhere in the US, since it gets them a foot in the door towards permanent residency?

See, for every scenario, there are multiple possible solutions. The policy for the past few decades has been to trust employers to decide if H1Bs are the best solution, but clearly they are often making choices that do not benefit Americans.

So we need to take some of that discretion away from employers, but because there are so many different scenarios to consider, it’s hard to craft a one-size-fits-all policy.",1

"‘I Didn’t Do That’: Biden Throws More Gasoline On ‘Transgender Visibility’ Day Outcry After Speaking To Press \n And here's the transgender one.


On Transgender Day of Visibility, we honor the extraordinary courage and contributions of transgender Americans and reaffirm our Nation’s commitment to forming a more perfect Union — where all people are created equal and treated equally throughout their lives.  


I am proud that my Administration has stood for justice from the start, working to ensure that the LGBTQI+ community can live openly, in safety, with dignity and respect. I am proud to have appointed transgender leaders to my Administration and to have ended the ban on transgender Americans serving openly in our military. I am proud to have signed historic Executive Orders that strengthen civil rights protections in housing, employment, health care, education, the justice system, and more. I am proud to have signed the Respect for Marriage Act into law, ensuring that every American can marry the person they love. 


Transgender Americans are part of the fabric of our Nation. Whether serving their communities or in the military, raising families or running businesses, they help America thrive. They deserve, and are entitled to, the same rights and freedoms as every other American, including the most fundamental freedom to be their true selves. But extremists are proposing hundreds of hateful laws that target and terrify transgender kids and their families — silencing teachers; banning books; and even threatening parents, doctors, and nurses with prison for helping parents get care for their children. These bills attack our most basic American values: the freedom to be yourself, the freedom to make your own health care decisions, and even the right to raise your own child. It is no surprise that the bullying and discrimination that transgender Americans face is worsening our Nation’s mental health crisis, leading half of transgender youth to consider suicide in the past year. At the same time, an epidemic of violence against transgender women and girls, especially women and girls of color, continues to take too many lives. Let me be clear: All of these attacks are un-American and must end. No one should have to be brave just to be themselves.  


At the same time, my Administration is working to stop the bullying and harassment of transgender children and their families. The Department of Justice has taken action to push back against extreme and un-American State laws targeting transgender youth and their families and the Department of Justice is partnering with law enforcement and community groups to combat hate and violence. My Administration is also providing dedicated emergency mental health support through our nationwide suicide and crisis lifeline — any LGBTQI+ young person in need can call “988” and press “3” to speak with a counselor trained to support them. We are making public services more accessible for transgender Americans, including with more inclusive passports and easier access to Social Security benefits. There is much more to do. I continue to call on the Congress to pass the Equality Act, to codify civil rights protections for all LGBTQI+ Americans.


Today, we send a message to all transgender Americans: You are loved. You are heard. You are understood. You belong. You are America, and my entire Administration and I have your back.


NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 31, 2024, as Transgender Day of Visibility. I call upon all Americans to join us in lifting up the lives and voices of transgender people throughout our Nation and to work toward eliminating violence and discrimination based on gender identity.


     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.


                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR",1

"Trump tells ICE to pause raids on hotels, farms and restaurants \n 1) The industries in question are saying that the employees are difficult to replace.

If it is truly scenario A (which I don't believe it is), then that's what the H1-B is for.  I agree with you that these roles are not highly skilled and thus, the likely reason for this lobbying is Scenario B.

2) Cyclical means it goes in a circle, like the oft cited: ""Bad times make good men, good men makes good times, good times make bad men, bad men make bad times"".  What you described is not cyclical, but the slippery slope (not in a fallacious sense, but in an actual sense) of government involvement.  Yes, the government should be less involved.  It should eliminate the minimum wage and let private businesses and private citizens interact in the open, transparent market.  And it should only allow people into the country that have arrived via the various legal channels set up for that purpose.

"‘People feel drained’: anti-Trump Americans face temptation to tune out \n News just feels like the daily damage report. I am barely keeping up with Heather Cox Richardson and Beau (now Belle since they changed the name of the channel and she’s taken over apparently fully). 

But yeah I spent so much time doing everything I could that I was good at to beat him and we lost. I pulled out my old 1st edition DnD books and am trying to get lost in nostalgia until we get another chance. 

Anybody tried to talk about Trump I implement a simple strategy:  

My current favorite approach is to be as simple and vague as possible. “I don’t trust the guy.”  Repeat every time someone says anything about him or any other nutcase. Like a broken record. It gives them no where to go. If  they do go into meltdown just cross your arms and repeat it.

Do NOT argue. Do not reason with them. Do not give them anything but those few words. It gives them no place to go. And it does put them in a bind. They and their dear leader will have to bear the responsibility of anything and everything that goes wrong. You bear no burden of proof or responsibly. Their guy won, so you need not defend any of your positions.

This avoids the problem of having to spend time arguing. And if you were to make a prediction, it won’t be proven until it comes true. What if something happens that mitigates your prediction? For example, if Trump only deports a few people, but makes a really big show of it. His voters will be convinced he did what he said he would (he didn’t in our scenario, but they won’t believe that) and then they will gloat over their false reality. So don’t give them anything they can win. Give them nothing.",0

Trump’s most recent hate-filled abomination was suggesting to a delighted white “Christian conservative” audience that the UFC should throw immigrants into locked cages with professional fighters for entertainment. The “Christian” crowd laughed and applauded when he said: “I think the migrant guy might win. That’s how tough they are.… These are tough people. These people are tough, and they’re nasty. Mean. It’s incredible that they come [here to America] totally unchecked.”

There truly is no bottom when it comes to Trump and his willingness to use hate and sadism to try to stay out of prison.

Here in America in the 1940s, Time, Life, and Fortune magazines produced anti-hate films funded by the U.S. government to deal with the legacy of hateful American prewar support for Nazism and the Klan. The military itself produced similar films explaining how and why hate had destroyed Germany and brought us into the war as a result.

Our government should undertake a similar effort, in collaboration with major media companies that have sworn off promoting hatred. Hopefully, if we all engage, we can prevent any more 3-year-olds from becoming the victims of Trump’s, Fox’s, and the GOP’s use of hate as a cheap political weapon.",0

If you have any sort of accent different than American, they are talking about you. 

This is racism and it exists within all populations, and it is horrible. The way to fix it — start to realize that you are no better than anyone else because of the color of your skin or your family’s background.

No, T and his MAGAS were not going to support you, because they are among some of the most racist of all. And that’s what we didn’t want him/them leading our country.

Biden has been the most pro union president in decades even at the expense of his party and the economy. Yet Dems will probably lose the union vote because despite the endorsement from management, most rank and file are hard right wingers.

Rose is reportedly scheduled to speak at the upcoming Republican National Convention. “Christians and conservatives should not support this,” Ellis added.

That's a sloppy omission

&gt; Chad Connelly, the former chair of the South Carolina GOP, expressed disappointment felt by his Christian constituents. “It is fair to say that over 1,000 pastors have emailed, texted and called me about their disappointment over where they saw the platform going,” he said, according to NBC, claiming that he’d been kept out of the platform committee after being “labeled ‘too pro-life.’”
&gt; 
&gt; Connelly is also the president and founder of Faith Wins, a supposedly nonpartisan group that mobilizes faith leaders to “leverage” their influence in government and politics. In the past, Connelly used his religious ties to round up voters for Trump, and now it seems he’s beginning to defect.
&gt; 
&gt; “The words I am hearing are shocked, betrayed, trampled, depressed, deflated,” Connelly said. “Most pastors I know don’t want Biden and will still probably vote for Trump, but this hurts the energy needed for those folks to do the things it takes to help elect a president.”

People don’t care about the finer details of these economic plans, and when they see all the economists saying that Trump’s plan won’t work, they dismiss it because trust in our institutions is the lowest it’s ever been.

Folks treat it as if they're noticing something for the first time, or just starting to do something rather than the reality that they've consistently worked on the situation for years.

It's done every five minutes through Biden's administration whenever he addressed student loans or climate change or the economy or whatever issue of the day. It's the stilted media landscape we're in where the media just doesn't want to report on things appropriately, it doesn't reach the 'front page' on social media too often, particularly if it helps Democrats. 

And often enough bad actors promote the sentiment, as the 'vibe' of 'do nothing Democrats' depresses their support. It seems to me this last election was all about that 'vibe' sentiment.",0

They could not conceive - or at least did not take seriously - that an overarching political party, loyal only to itself, could unite around a cult of personality in one entity and coordinate to seize all 3 branches for the sole purpose of its own power. 

Although they feared bad people could win presidential elections, they believed the Electoral College in its OG form would act to prevent them from taking office. 

However over time the College changed form &amp; purpose, removing even this last check.

"Now That Trump Won The Election - Will Joe Biden Be The Last Great President? \n I don’t think he’ll have the guts. Certainly not 60% tariffs along with mass deportations and denaturalization. It annoys the hell out of me, because the _‘enlightened’_ Republicans’ favourite talking point was “she has no policies, she stands for nothing,” but he has good form saying populist shit that is obviously absurd and never followed through by his actions. 

He’ll do just enough - apply the odd tariff here or there, build another few miles of wall, send back a couple thousand illegal migrants already in custody - for his sycophantic supporters to point and say “see how effective our governance is.” All the while benefiting from the Biden administration’s infrastructure bills, economic recovery plan and record growth.

It’s also why I thought the “threat to democracy” campaign message was fundamentally flawed and would fail to cut through. What we’re most likely to see, in my opinion, is not the end to absolute democracy but another four years of incremental backsliding on democratic norms and human rights, another four years of increasing economic polarization, another four years of elite billionaire-led corporatocracy.

"Biden defends himself over documents..... An investigation that was a political hit job by the investigator. \n ✅ The whole thing was a hit job by a partisan special prosecutor, editorializing a report that essentially just confirms one crucial point: President Biden hasn’t committed any crime.

✅ All they’ve got on Biden is his age. 🙄(It is what it is, folks. I’m sorry it bugs people, but there it is.) Meanwhile, we’ve got Nazis, white supremacists, and insurrectionists trying to rip our country apart. In the grand scheme, Biden’s age is the least of our worries. In fact, it’s an asset. He’s the bridge to a future where democracy still stands.

✅ Biden’s leadership and ability to unite brought us the win in 2020 and will do it again in 2024. We don’t need a president who can run marathons. We need one who isn’t an insurrectionist. And yes, that’s a low bar, but it seems too many voting white Americans are tripping over it.

✅ President Biden is a Bridge. Fixing democracy isn’t an overnight job. It could speed up, but too many sit out on Election Day.

I’m referring to those who opt out because they’re tired or think their lives won’t change either way, or the young folks who moan about everything but won’t show up to vote.

✅ Donald Trump is a criminal who hoarded documents. When asked to return them, he obstructed and clung to them. Meanwhile, Biden cooperated immediately, agreeing to a transparent investigation without hesitation.

✅ Unlike Trump and his cronies, Biden and the Democrats admit their faults and genuinely respect our institutions.

✅ And let’s be real—if Biden had actually done something criminal, Democrats would be the first to call for impeachment, not blindly defend and excuse the behavior. We’ve got to act, not just vent. This is about protecting and participating in our democracy, not standing by as it’s threatened.",0

"Ohio, Michigan Republicans in Released Audio: ""Endgame"" Is To Ban Trans Care ""For Everyone"" \n No fucking shit.

THEY ARE SYSTEMATICALLY CRIMINALIZING OUR FUCKING EXISTENCE! And cis queer people are next on the goddamn block!

This is not a fucking game! They are working towards making the legal existence of trans people a goddamn sex crime! They are criminalizing our health care and banning us from updating ID, making it fucking impossible for us to exist *without* being immediately publicly identifiable as trans, while passing ""drag"" bans and [**classifying our existence as pornographic**](https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/09/08/conservative-think-tank-project-2025/)!

The fascist US White Christian Nationalist movement made promises of our eradication their path into power, and god help us it is working! In about half the country they are increasingly in positions to start following through on those promises! And they started with trans people but are quickly expanding to cis queer people too!

They are rapidly building the social and legal framework for making transition effectively impossible, and classify the public existence of sex and gender variance outside cis/straight norms to be pedophilic grooming by exposing children to degenerate sexual activity. Even if all we're doing is standing in line at the goddam grocery store.

They are banning our medical care, threatening doctors with jail time, and demanding hospitals turn over patient data including everything from names to medical photos.

And passing ""drag bans"" that classify gender variance as inherently sexual and obscene and inappropriate for children to see, and ""exposing"" children to our presence as child sexual abuse.

And trying to seize trans children from supportive cis parents and criminally charge those parents, on the grounds that allowing their child's transition is on par with raping them.

And trying to [**seize all children from families with a trans parent or sibling**](https://www.businessinsider.com/florida-anti-trans-bill-court-custody-kids-gender-affirming-care-2023-3) on the grounds that exposure to a trans person is child abuse.

And laws allowing pharmacists, desk workers and nurses, among others, to refuse to dispense medication or complete paperwork for transgender patients seeking gender-affirming care.

And in his concurring opinion after striking down Roe, Thomas wrote that the SCOTUS rulings prohibiting states from banning contraceptives, gay marriage, and ""sodomy"" may also be ""up for review"" too.

If ""sodomy"" laws are allowed to return, cis queer people's existence will be officially criminalized too. When queer relationships are by definition a sex crime, the public existence of cis queer people will be criminalized as pedophic grooming just like trans people's public existence currently is.

It doesn't take a psychic to see where they're going here.",0

Obama talked about it, Biden talked about it, it's not just a Trump hobby-horse. But how did Trump go about trying to deal with China? He mindlessly started a trade war with Canada and the EU, antagonized Mexico in many ways, crapped all over NATO, knob-slobbed Putin, and then tried to demand the entire world form a coalition to help combat Chinese trade problems.  You need happy, grateful allies in order to build that kind of coalition, because members are going to need to justify the (hopefully temporary) economic pain that such action would demand. Too bad Trump has made those kinds of alliances all but impossible.

(True evil geniuses don't struggle with basic math.) At 217-215, the entire Republican House majority will depend on whether MTG has 'roid rage that day or not.

Trump will probably throw out a line from *Mein Kampf* to horrify and distract you while his cronies are busy looting the Treasury. He'll do nothing and then declare victory over problems that he made up out of thin air. His coalition has already started in-fighting and he hasn't even taken office yet.

I expect another clown show like his first term. The country will hobble along like it did before and as long as there isn't another crisis that he is completely incapable of handling, like COVID, we'll come out of it in four years.

They have no beliefs. They aren’t fiscally conservative. They aren’t constitutionally conservative. They aren’t pro-freedom. They aren’t small government. They aren’t even Christians anymore.

They are whatever the Democrats aren’t. They’re spoilers. They are the people you vote into office to make the younger generations feel bad at Thanksgiving dinner.

They just want someone to root for to win. They don’t give a fuck what they are winning.

US threatens new ICC sanctions unless court pledges not to prosecute Trump \n He should have been in prison already. If you or I assaulted a woman sexually or did fraud for 30 years on our mortgage and property ownership we be in jail for 20 years or more.

"How did Kamala succeed so easily at debating Trump compared to Biden and Clinton? \n One word: humor. She started laughing at him from the get-go, as did Walz. That doesn’t mean Trump isn’t dangerous and we don’t need to push hard for this election. But at this point we know his foibles and they’ve basically given us permission to laugh at him, which really has him on the back foot, gasping for air.

They’re also words that are thrown around and have lost meaning. But weird, weird hasn’t lost meaning. Weird isn’t attached to any fact… it’s just a negative feeling, and there’s no defense to it.

"Katie Porter opens door to presidential age limits in Senate debate \n The minimum age to run for POTUS is 35, right? There are people out there who are 35 who are not what I'd call 'mentally competent', have little-to-no awareness of what's going on the world, can't do basic arithmetic, and so on. Meanwhile there's 80-year-olds who are trained engineers and scientists and doctors who are still sharp as a razor.

"Biden Says He Regrets Not Signing Name to Covid Checks Like Trump Did \n It did work. I was talking with my brother trying to convince him to vote. He never votes and it isn’t important to him but he did say that if he did end up voting he would vote Trump since he is the only politician that sent him money. 

I tried to explain he also received stimulus from Biden but he didn’t think so. All he could talk about was the check from Trump.",0

"Trump Says Taylor Swift Will 'Pay a Price in the Marketplace' for Harris Endorsement \n It's also said about her, is that she pays the people that work for her. Even gives them bonuses because she feels bad about keeping them away from home so much. Unlike Trump who steals the money and then files bankruptcy so he doesn't need to pay the working class",0
"Kamala Harris leads Donald Trump in Michigan by 3 points in final Detroit Free Press poll \n Still within the margin of error. 

Vote. Vote. Vote. We need more than just MI.",0
"The Lincoln Project on Instagram: ""Democrats, stop panicking and start organizing. This is Kamala Harris' race to win."" \n Because 2016 and 2020 had Trump over performance based on the final polling, the race being this close, based on those trends leads to a Trump win. I personally think Harris is going to win by 10 but it’s still tough seeing the polling be so close and knowing what has happened before",0
"Republicans raising tax for people with low income. \n Good god the mid-terms need to be here already! Just disgusting.

"Biden Blames Racism And Sexism For Kamala Harris Losing To Trump \n Occupant 47-s voters were either down with the cruelty OR didn't bother to do any research...his voters are, as we know, ""low information voters"".  They voted for that Apprentice guy, not the too-smart black lady.

Now that their job is disappearing because of Occupant 47, maybe they'll vote for the white male person the Democrats run next go round.

WE read Project 2025, his voters didn't.",0
"DNC goers, be aware! \n Speaking as a journalist, James O’Keefe is a complete piece of shit. If his “gotcha” bullshit ever had any actual “gotcha” in it I’d respect his work. Instead, he gets some random production assistant to “spill” that some producer has liberal leanings and thinks that is tantamount to the org being in the bag for the Dems. He’s the student who doesn’t complete the assignment. He fucking sucks.",0
Alarming Report Warns Of ‘Greatest Threat To American Democracy You’ve Never Heard Of’ \n It's all the same threat. The GOP is filled with fascists that hate the American people.,0
"Republicans Who Became Democrats, What's Your Story? \n Grew up voting straight-ticket Republican. Bought into the family values, hard work and opportunity ideals. Russia was the “bad guys”. The Constitution was to be upheld.

Along comes Trump and all that went out the window. A trust fund baby with the “morals of an alley cat” who loves Russia, lies all the time and sees the e Constitution as a limitation to his lust for power. 

Voted for a third party candidate in 2016 because I still bought into the Republican messaging about Hillary.

After Trump took office I went all in on voting Democratic. Donated money for the first time. I am not going back. I may not agree with all of the Democratic platform, but at least they have a platform.  I’m here and I’m all in for Kamala/Walz as Donald Trump needs to never be in the Oval Office again.",0
"Polls show young voters going for Trump and older voters backing Biden. What's going on? - POLITICO \n The only young voters who are answering these polls are;

A. Young voters with a landline.

B. Young voters who read/answer spam emails.",0
Audience laughs at Donald Trump as he tries to explain why he can’t speak coherently anymore -- we gotta get him out of his cave \n Kamala’s best strategy has been telling people to watch his rallies. The proof is in the orange pudding.,0
"Trump says federal workers who don't want to return to the office are ""going to be dismissed"" \n ""The president-elect said ""it was like a gift to a union, and we're going to obviously be in court to stop it."" He said federal workers who don't return to in-office work will be fired.""

I wonder how the union members that voted for tRump will feel about this?",0
"Thanks and some advice \n They have their future list of potus candidates already and where the DNC money will go. 

I really appreciate Biden saying the other night that ""he will repect the constitution and law.""

But we are not going up against a Bush, a Regan, or a Romney. We are going up against a wannabe dictator who boasts about it daily.

It's time to play dirty Joe. Get to it and show you will fight.",0
"Why this Latino Harris voter says he's 'happy' Trump won \n I would love if Democrats had a blue tsunami in '28 after the inevitable collapse of the economy, but we know that the average voter has the memory to that of a dementia ridden goldfish and will probably just vote for whatever name they recognize more.",0
Rep. Jasmine Crockett has a plan for Democrats to take the house before the midterms. \n Anyone that stays home is as guilty as Trump is for the destruction of this country,0
"I feel like its not talked about enough how Bush &amp; GOP stole election from Al Gore \n That was bad. But I'm way more pissed about what Mitch McConnell did to Merrick Garland. Democracy really ended there and they got away with it, like no big deal.",0
Trump accuses Dems of wanting a shutdown after failed Senate vote \n We need to shut this down; give the GOP a taste of its own medicine after refusing to work with democratic presidents and threatening shutdown themselves.,0
US funding plan collapses as Trump makes demands days before shutdown \n We gotta start volunteering and getting ready for midterms. Gotta capitalize on how much they’re going to absolutely trash everything. ,0
"In an telling swap of strategies, Trump's team is insisting on muted mics, while Kamala's team want them on. \n It also preempts accusations of bias if Trump has a  bad performance. “The fake news media was muting Trump’s mic on purpose to sabotage him.”",0
"Trump's Tax Plan \n Here's an illustration of Trump's tax plan - raise our taxes, but LOWER billionaires’ taxes. 

Is that the kind of president you want? 

BTW, you don't have to tell anyone who you are voting for if you feel pressured by friends and family - it's ok to vote for Kamala.",0
"Indiana Republican called out by Trump on redistricting is swatted \n The second you're no longer on Trump's side, his followers turn on you like a pack of rabid pitbulls, Republicans should wake up to the reality that sucking Trump's boots won't save you from getting stomped on.",0
"Bannon Warns Trump and Musk: There’s ‘A Lot of MAGAs on Medicaid’ and They ‘Can’t Take a Meat Axe To It’ (gee you don't say) \n Exactly. He got all their donations and their votes. That's all he wanted or needed from them. He has no use for them now, nor does he care what becomes of them.",0
"I lost 2 friends in Iraq, as well as my ability to walk without a cane. Makes my blood boil seeing the right using today and dead Americans as a campaign advertisement.  \n I notice they aren't calling for anyone to say the names of the four Army special ops soldiers who died in the ambush in Niger in 2018.  Trump can't even say Niger correctly without notes.",0
"Trump says he was being a 'bit sarcastic' when he promised to end Russia-Ukraine war in 24 hours \n Narcissists are well known to make grand statements and then claim they were only kidding when it doesn’t turn out that way.  The really creepy thing though is that they legitimately believe this too.  Because the mind of a narcissist can’t ever allow for any admission of a mistake.  So the “it was only a joke” pronouncement is just as much for their own psychological state as it is to try to convince the rest of us.  

Narcissism is a terrible condition, and it’s exceptionally bad when someone with money or power has it.  It’s essentially how all the significant human tragedies of history have come to pass.",0
"MAGA Republicans will get butthurt over literally the smallest thing and honestly it's hilarious \n Hobby Lobby is allowed to enforce it's morals onto its employees, but Green Day cannot choose the lyrics to their own songs?  That's wild.",0
"MO House Republicans blocked Democrats from speaking and did not allow the public inside in violation of the State Constitution \n Republicans flout the rules and basic ethical practices, then do the same! 

I'm tired of this game we play where they ignore the rules but still manage to use them against everyone else!",0
"As a woman, what do you think of the men in your life who are going to vote for trump? \n I've been wondering once my dad is dead if I'd want to be back in contact with my brother. I checked his voter registration and uh, no, no I'll be keeping away from that mess even then it appears. No other men that would even consider voting for GOP in my life.",0
"10 ways to be prepared and grounded now that Trump has won \n A ""setback""? Political violence, an attempted coup, holding all three branches of the government, foreign interference, filling the cabinet with loyalists and a corrupted Supreme Court. At what point is any of that more than a ""setback"".

We have, and have had, our warning for years now. They aren't even bothering to conceal their intentions. Trump's contempt for the country is palpable. The time is now to defend our democracy. Not sure how you read that as ""giving up"".  Leadership 1) acknowledges the true threat to our country and 2) defends our democracy.",0
"Transcript: Fox News Visibly Rattled as Trump’s Slide in Polls Worsens; As Fox News personalities work overtime to shield their viewers from Trump's deepening unpopularity, a shrewd observer of right wing media explains the deeper problems this reveals for the MAGA movement. \n It’s going to be interesting to see what happens.  At some point, the impact of Trump’s policies are going to be so front and center, it’s going to be hard for Fox to ignore. To pick just one example the number of active drilling rigs in the United States is dropping, as is the number of oil drilling jobs. He told a big whopper at the very start, that he would both increase drilling in the United States and decrease the cost of gasoline. For one of those things to be true, the other has to be false. Foreign oil is still much cheaper than fracked oil, and no executive order can change that",0
Send this to a Republican!  \n This is far more common than republicans would ever dare to admit. Bunch of hypocrites.,0
"Perspective | The unanswered question of our time: Is Trump an agent of Russia? (From September 2020.) \n There's not just smoke, but fire.  It's not rumor or conjecture, but facts.

Let’s just hope justice gets served.",0

Adelita Grijalva won an election more than 6 weeks ago, and she still hasn’t been sworn in to represent more than 800,000 Arizonans. \n We’re at a point where we have to ask who is paying Mike Johnson to keep the Epstein files from public view.",0

"Fascism’s most powerful backers: The Mercers may go all in on the coup-attempting Trump \n Goes to show that once ideologically obsessed billionaires like the Mercers are allowed to gain undue influence over politics through the power of their wealth, and use their influence to accrue even more wealth and even more power, it’s a potential democracy-ender. So many people saw this coming and were told not to worry.",0

No one should have to drive 20 miles during work hours and stand in line for 3-4 just to vote. They do this on purpose because they know those who lean left work during the day and can’t take the time off. And even if they do get off,  they are discouraged because of the long lines. 

Meanwhile the right (white) leaning voters take 30 min max and drive down the street.

If I’m not mistaken, there’s one voting precinct for all of the Houston area. Why would you do this if not to disenfranchise voters.

"I absolutely believe that if he loses, Trump will run again in 2028. What do you think?  \n Regardless of Trump, his party supported a coup attempt.

Through an astonishing combination of guile, instinct, foresight, and plain luck, Trump finds himself in a position of unchallenged power in the White House.

And this is where the comparison with Hitler is worthy of note; there is nobody to rein him in.

...he would claim that he is now the most powerful U.S. president in history. And he may be right.

He has steamrolled Congress into accepting his agenda-defining policy bill despite the ardent opposition of the GOP deficit hawks, the centrist chickens, and the MAGA vultures. 

He harangued the Supreme Court into backing his deportation flights to God knows where. He humbled academia into accepting his lunatic DEI demands by cutting off its cash.

And he has browbeaten the media, forcing CBS and ABC into humiliating settlements nobody truly thought they should pay. He even kicked the Associated Press out of the White House press briefings and replaced the venerable agency with right-wing pigeon posts.

The president of the United States can do whatever he wants, and there is nobody to stop him.

They need another horse race with new names and new stars. They need new alliances, quotes, and betrayals. They need ratings, and the money and attention it gets them. They crave relevance and are happy to destroy Democracy in order to keep their positions in the eyes of their wealthy bosses. Fuck these people.",0

"Who’s your favorite Democrat right now? \n The feature that made me happiest was that seven democrats were proposed as potential VP's and that each were excellent candidates for the position.  The GOP proposed VP candidates were universally unlikable and mostly evil people.

"The United States of America and the people Vs. Donald J. Trump, and the GOP party \n Normal administrations get the usual relationship timelines - 6 months of ""can do no wrong"" honeymoon, then a re-assessment for how it's going at 2 years (Todd treats me well but I can't stand the way he leaves the toothpaste cap off so he's got to go), then the usual ""is this all there is?"" life reassessments at 7 year intervals.

Trump's administration is not following the usual scripts, so the assessments will be more frequent and coming faster.  Normal administrations set broad goals in motion in the honeymoon phase.  They bear fruit over the next couple of years as laws are passed to enact them, agencies reorganizes in response, new regulations are drafted and put up for review, and so on.  In 2 years the new legal/regulatory structures are in place and we begin to see how society reacts to them.  These lags are intentional; the Constitutional process is deliberately slow and difficult so that we don't get wild swings in policy.

Trump is completely bypassing the normal checks and balances. He's not the boyfriend that keeps forgetting birthdays, he's the one actively slapping family members around.  The cat has been missing for days and we suspect it isn't alive anymore.  Law enforcement is getting calls every day.  He's not going to get a honeymoon, he's going to get a restraining order.  The January to April lag is just the time it takes to convince a judge that one is needed.",0

Former Kamala Harris aide suggests Biden should resign so she can be the 47th president … \n The glass ceiling was broken in a similar way in Canada. An unpopular Prime Minister resigned and Kim Campbell took the roll.. for 6 months in 1993. Unfortunately a woman has not been elected again.,0

"Why does Trump have no rallies next week?  \n Living in the east TN area less than an hour's drive away from Asheville, NC, I wouldn't be surprised if Trump is banking on turnout from surrounding counties to bolster his crowd size. Even if that means voters from outside the state. Appearances are everything to him.

That said, Trump barely won NC in 2020. He needs a strong show of support to increase his voter turnout. Campaigning in a blue city is detrimental on paper, but I'm sure his strategists are hoping for this rally's crowd size to sway his base's waning trust in his campaign.

TL;DR: Trump chose a blue city because of its proximity to ""safer"" red cities. He's hoping to energize his base in NC and keep it red in the 2024 election.",0
"Do you think Harris is being underestimated? \n FWIW, polling misses tend to be cyclical and if the cycle holds, the polls are likely to be overestimating the Republican vote in 2024.

"Convincing a Trump voter who dislikes Trump - but somehow dislikes Biden more - to vote for Biden? \n &gt; tell him that it's not possible to broadly deflate price of goods. That's terrible for an economy. 

This is what pissed me off. Deflation is mainly bad as it made people avoid doing transactions/investments and often spiraling out of control. It's only good if it's caused by better technology that make supply and transportation more efficient, or in case of housing, less restrictive zonings.",0
"Trump's Iowa lead shrinks significantly as Kamala Harris replaces Biden, Iowa Poll shows. \n Yes, but it also has the worst voter suppression of the four states.

"Farah Griffin: Trump talked about executing people at several White House meetings \n Please keep in mind that the *only* book Trump seems to have actually read was a collection of Hitler’s speeches.

But we can't change the damn past so the second best time to start is now. We can either be bummed about the history or coalesce and start building the future. The GOP wins shit because when push comes to shove, literal white supremacists and Christians support the same party in the voting booth. Wild to think, but that's what's happening. So keep that in mind next time you're fighting your fellow Dems over something.

Oh and all this is happening because people are shouting in the streets, calling their reps, and generally causing a ruckus. That's how shit gets done - always has, always will.",0
"Trump says $50 million for his “big, beautiful” birthday parade is just “peanuts.” To veterans he's fired, it could pay to hire them back. Maybe it's “peanuts” if you’re making millions on crypto schemes, but it's real money taken from veterans’ pockets. \n Only dictators ask for military parades. We DON'T have military parades here, except at the conclusion of a war. It destroyes the civilian economic infrastructure, the streets. It glorifies might over right. And, if corrupted enough, it simply glorifies one undeserving and insignificant man. Most countries don't give draft dodgers military parades!

In 100 days Trump destroyed our leadership of the free world. Brought fascism to America. Caused several constitutional crisis. Broken dozens of laws. Made us less safe. A corrupt broken administration.

Trump no follows the constitution, he laughs at SCOTUS while accepting no responsibility: doesn't know, blames lawyers, makes excuses, tell lies, misdirected the media, threatens everyone that won't comply. Enough.

WHEN are his cult followers going to wake up? MAGA is a cult and a religion. They can’t admit the great orange one has failed miserably and made their lives worse. 🤦‍♀️
